  "longDescription": "FERENDy is an innovative consumer recommendation platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized product suggestions. The platform is designed to revolutionize online shopping by understanding user preferences and delivering highly relevant recommendations.\n\nCurrently in development, FERENDy will feature advanced AR product previews, allowing users to visualize products in their own environment before making a purchase. The AI-driven matching algorithms analyze user behavior, preferences, and contextual data to provide increasingly accurate recommendations over time.\n\nThis project showcases my expertise in consumer-facing applications, AI integration, and emerging technologies like augmented reality. It represents the future of e-commerce where technology enhances rather than complicates the shopping experience.",
