  "longDescription": "30Bin is an intelligent movie recommendation platform that uses artificial intelligence to help users discover their next favorite film. The app asks users a series of questions about their preferences, mood, and viewing history, then uses OpenAI's advanced language models to generate three highly personalized movie recommendations.\n\nBuilt with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), 30Bin features a clean, intuitive interface that makes movie discovery fun and engaging. The AI-powered recommendation engine considers factors like genre preferences, mood, time constraints, and viewing history to provide suggestions that users are likely to enjoy.\n\nThis project showcases my full-stack development skills, AI integration expertise, and ability to create engaging user experiences. It demonstrates how modern web technologies can be combined with AI to solve everyday problems in creative ways.",
