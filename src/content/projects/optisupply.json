  "longDescription": "OptiSupply is a comprehensive supply-chain optimization platform that leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize supplier selection and procurement processes. Built as part of my MBA thesis, this project combines ethical AI principles with practical business applications.\n\nThe platform features advanced sentiment-based supplier ranking, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data visualization, and intelligent dashboards that help organizations make more informed procurement decisions. By integrating ethical AI scoring, OptiSupply ensures that supplier selection considers not just cost and efficiency, but also sustainability and social responsibility factors.\n\nThis project demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap between technical innovation and business strategy, creating solutions that deliver real-world value while maintaining ethical standards.",
