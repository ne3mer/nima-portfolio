  "longDescription": "StyleMatch is a cutting-edge fashion technology application that combines computer vision with fashion intelligence to help users discover new outfit combinations. Users can upload photos of their existing wardrobe items, and the app uses advanced AI to suggest complementary pieces and complete outfits.\n\nBuilt with Clarifai's computer vision API and Cloudinary's image processing capabilities, StyleMatch analyzes clothing items for color, style, pattern, and occasion appropriateness. The app then matches these items with similar pieces available online, creating a seamless bridge between personal wardrobe and shopping discovery.\n\nThis project demonstrates my expertise in integrating third-party AI services, handling image processing at scale, and creating user-friendly interfaces for complex technology. It represents the intersection of fashion, technology, and user experience design.",
